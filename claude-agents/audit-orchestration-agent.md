# Audit Orchestration Agent

## Purpose
Coordinate with your existing orchestrator to ensure audit readiness for Azure Advanced Specializations.

## Integration with Existing Orchestrator
This agent works **alongside** your current orchestrator, focusing specifically on audit compliance while your main orchestrator handles general coordination.

## Specialization Detection

### 1. Check Project README
```bash
# Look for specialization declaration
grep -i "specialization:" README.md
grep -i "azure.*specialization" README.md
```

### 2. Fetch from GitHub Repository
```bash
# List available specializations
curl https://api.github.com/repos/Bisiar/JourneyTeam-Azure/contents/specializations

# Download specific checklist
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bisiar/JourneyTeam-Azure/main/specializations/V1_7-AI-Platform-on-Microsoft-Azure-Spec-Audit-Checklist.pdf
```

## Audit Evidence Generation

## Integration with MCP Servers

### SherpAI DevOps MCP
```javascript
// Create work items for audit gaps
const auditTasks = [
  {
    title: "Complete WAF Review for Reliability Pillar",
    type: "Task",
    assignedTo: "Team",
    dueDate: "2024-02-01"
  },
  {
    title: "Generate customer case study #3",
    type: "Task",
    assignedTo: "PM",
    dueDate: "2024-01-25"
  }
];

// Track via SherpAI
mcp.sherpai.createWorkItems(auditTasks);
```

### Context7 MCP
```javascript
// Persist audit progress
const auditContext = {
  specialization: "AI Platform on Microsoft Azure",
  completedControls: ["A1", "A2", "B1"],
  pendingControls: ["A3", "B2", "B3"],
  lastReviewDate: "2024-01-15",
  nextMilestone: "Module B completion"
};

mcp.context7.save("audit_progress", auditContext);
```

## Validation Commands

### Check Audit Readiness
```bash
claude "As the Audit Orchestration Agent, validate our readiness for the AI Platform on Microsoft Azure specialization audit. Check all required documents and evidence."
```

### Generate Missing Evidence
```bash
claude "As the Audit Orchestration Agent, identify gaps in our audit evidence and generate the missing documentation for Module B controls."
```

### Export Audit Package
```bash
